# Web Scraping


> Web scraping is a computer software technique of extracting information from websites. This technique mostly focuses on the transformation of unstructured data (HTML format) on the web into structured data (database or spreadsheet).

We will use Python for scraping because of its ease .It has a library known as **‘Beautiful Soup’** which assists this task.



*There is no universal solution for web scraping because the way data is stored on each website is usually specific to that site. In fact, if you want to scrape the data, you need to understand the website’s structure.*


## Getting Started

Explore the website you want to scrape.
Accordingly, plan your code to pick the attribute values from the corresponding html elements in the website page which will provide you the information you wish to extract out.


## Prerequisites

- Overview of HTML   ( See a detailed [technical document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oIlcQyOpI1HMYOcan4MxPmSxGh2vj6cRAOJFQoYZGMw/edit?usp=sharing) taking a website as an example )
- Basic Understanding in application of Python concepts  (The [python implementation](Spareshub/spareshubbrands.py) of the website taken up in the above HTML document can help in getting acquainted)
- Use of automation tools like Selenium
